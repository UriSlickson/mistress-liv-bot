Error from Railway logs (Jan 11, 2026):

Command 'whoiowe' raised an exception: OperationalError: no such column: recipient_discord_id

The error is in /app/cogs/payments.py in the who_i_owe function.

The SQL query is trying to select a column called "recipient_discord_id" that doesn't exist in the database.
The actual column name in the payments table is "payee_discord_id" not "recipient_discord_id".
