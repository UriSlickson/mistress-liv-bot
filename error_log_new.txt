Error from Railway logs (Jan 12, 2026 01:49):

sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: r.last_dm_sent

The wager_reminders table doesn't exist in the production database.
The table is created in _ensure_reminder_table() but the LEFT JOIN is failing because the table doesn't have the expected columns.

Need to check if the table exists and has the correct schema.
