Per Szn Payout Structure

**League Basics**
- 32 teams (NFC payers fund pot; AFC free/partnered for easy fill).
- All payments P2P (Cash App/Venmo preferred).
- Commissioner does not collect payments.

**Same-Seed Ties & AFC Share**
- Each NFC team is paired for the season with the AFC team that finishes in the same seed position (e.g., NFC seed 5 paired with AFC seed 5).
- Pairings apply league-wide: playoff to playoff, non-playoff to non-playoff.
- The NFC partner handles all wagers/earnings for the paired AFC team.
- AFC partner gets 20% of their team's playoff earnings (paid post-season by NFC partner).
- Pre-playoffs election: AFC partner can elect to pay $50 to NFC partner → $50 returned first on that teams earnings, then 50/50 split of remaining AFC team earnings paid to the AFC member once paid for payouts.

**Playoff Pot ($900 Max)**
- Paid by NFC non-playoff seeds 8-16 ($100 each P2P when full).
- Payouts go to previous season's playoff winners, split by how far they advanced:
  - Seeds 15 & 16 pay a total of $100 each, but $50 to each of the (4) WC/Bye Winners.
  - Seeds 13 & 14 pay a total of $100 each to each of the (2) Division Winners.
  - Seeds 11 & 12 pay a total of $100 each to the (1) Conference Winner.
  - Seeds 8, 9, & 10 pay a total of $100 each to the (1) Super Bowl Winner.
- Dues are due by week 18 of the following season.

**Previous Season Playoff Payouts**
- WC/Bye Win Only = $50 (4 payouts)
- Divisional Win Only = $100 (2 payouts)
- Conference Win Only = $200 (1 payout)
- Super Bowl Win = $300 (1 payout)
- Pot Reduces $100 per (Open/CPU) NFC Team

**Payout Reduction from Open/CPU NFC Teams**
- CPU/open auto-assigned lowest NFC seeds (16 first, then down). CPU pays $0.
- Pot reductions (lower rounds first):
  - 1 open: WC/Bye earnings → $25 each.
  - 2 open: No WC/Bye earnings.
  - 3 open: No WC/Bye + Divisional → $50 each.
  - 4 open: No WC/Bye or Divisional.
  - Continues upward (e.g., 5 open: No WC/Bye/Div + Conference reduced).
- RS pot reduces $100 per missing NFC payer (auto-reduce highest recipients first or as defined in tracker).
