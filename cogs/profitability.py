Profitability Cog - Comprehensive payment generation, tracking, and franchise profitability
Features:
- Generate season payments based on NFC seeds and playoff results
- AFC/NFC seed pairing: AFC teams retain 20%, NFC teams get 80% of paired AFC earnings
- Clear/reset season payments
- Track franchise profitability (playoff earnings, wagers, dues)
- Post payment summaries to GM division channels
